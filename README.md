This repository contains various implementations and notes of recommender systems for the movie ratings dataset. The following algorithms are included:

* Matrix factorization with TensorFlow
* Matrix factorization with Spark
* Restricted Boltzmann Machines
* Deep Learning Recommenders
* Bayesian inference

These implementations were developed based on my understanding of the concepts and material covered in the "Recommender Systems and Deep Learning in Python" course on Udemy, as well as information obtained from Wikipedia and data science, papers and blogs, and ChatGPT.

The implementations are available as Jupyter notebooks or seperate scripts in their respective folders.
