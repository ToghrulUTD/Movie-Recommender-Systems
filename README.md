Recommender Systems with MovieLens

This repository contains various implementations of recommender systems for the MovieLens dataset. The following algorithms are included:

* Matrix factorization with TensorFlow
* Matrix factorization with Spark
* Restricted Boltzmann Machines
* Deep Learning Recommenders
* Bayesian inference

These implementations were developed based on my understanding of the concepts covered in the "Recommender Systems and Deep Learning in Python" course on Udemy, as well as information obtained from Wikipedia and data science, papers and blogs.

Usage
Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script. To run the algorithms, simply execute the desired script. The data used for the analysis can be found in the "data" folder.

The implementations are available as Jupyter notebooks in the "notebooks" folder. To run the algorithms, open the desired notebook and follow the instructions provided. The data used for the analysis can be found in the "data" folder.
